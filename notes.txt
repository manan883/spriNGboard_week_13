I think the output will print a 100 times with no spaces, then do the same for b and c. then print the statement after.

the actual output is random ordering of the letters. it randomizes every time.

when the program hits line A no threads have run yet
after commenting out one thread, the output is still jumbled but with only 2 letters.
the files that were there are core.xxxx files which are core dumps. these files hold the current state of the working memory while the program crashes.
